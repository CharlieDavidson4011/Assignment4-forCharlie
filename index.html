      <p> Driving straight through from Texas to the midwest right before a snow storm with my newly adopted shelter puppy riding shotgun was just as terrifyingly gratifying as it sounds.  </p>

      <p> class="intro"> I made the move after a few years of mulling it over from the safety of my Texas heat and mild winters. 
          Eventually, I decided to uproot after I did the math on how old my parents were...and after my grandpa had fallen off his ladder a couple too many times. 
          I said goodbye to my friends, a job I loved, and pre-nursing school with a couple of bucks in my back pocket and my #1 boy by my side. 
          My grandpa and dad helped my load up the belongings I'd racked up over the years.
          Mismatched furniture, rugby gear, and honestly, that's about it. 
          I was able to catch one more good show at my favorite venue, The Paper Tiger. 
          A little Japanese Breakfast was an excellent send-off.

         <h2>Dating Pre-Pandemic</h2>

         <img src="images/ghey.jpg" alt="Spicy Date">

         <p> 
              When I first got to the state of Missouri, I ended up in a small town about 35 miles east of Kansas City.
              Warrensburg has a population of 20,139, about half of which are UCM students. Go Mules!
              Naturally with those sorts of dismal statistics, I ventured into the world of dating apps, as opposed to taking my chances meeting somebody at the local Country Kitchen.
              My heart fell into an absolute free-fall when I met Lee.
              We met at a women's rally, as you do. And then continued to chat at Mud Pie's in Westport...as you do.
              Four hours later, I ran away (literally) with my hands in my pockets and nerves on high. They were perfect.
              We continued to go on hours long dates to estate sales, book stores, coffee shops, even planned a trip to San Antonio. 
              Until the world flew in a free-fall of it's own.

         <h2>Stop the Spread!</h2>

         <p>Initially, the pandemic was thought of as not much more serious than the flu.
             There was even a point in time where Lee and I were going to take advantage of the ultra cheap airline tickets. 
             But the severity of the pandemic was swift and completely blindsided the world. In the midst of this, a choice needed to be made.
             Move in and quarantine with Lee and their kids or see them when the pandemic was over. 
             I packed up my clothes and my pup and off to Kansas City we moved!</p>

         <h2>Kids...not the goats.</h2>

         <p>Isaiah and Jasmine were 11 and 13 when we met. They were sceptical. I was sceptical. 
             From their perspective, having just been told that they weren't going back to school after Spring Break was just the tip of the life chancing iceberg.
             We'd met a bunch of times before, broke bread, played games, etc. But now we were in a global pandemic and I was homeschooling teenagers. 
             The following picture just about sums it up. Lee was optimistic, Jasmine trying to be a great example of a big sister, and Isaiah was just truly over it.

         <p>But damnit we made it. The kids became closer than ever, we got the kids a proper tutor, and we did our best.
             Being a parental figure in the midst of a global crisis shifted my perspective a lot. <b>A LOT.</b> I'm such a papa bear, it's ridiculous. 
             The kids showed me that it's not that serious. I'm not as funny as I think I am. And sometimes, a perfect squeeze hug is better than any SSRI.
             <b>Obviously, still take your prescribed SSRI. Self care is important! </b>
         </p>

         <p>I'm not trying to sugar coat anything, the pandemic year was hard. I was a ball of anxiety, my pup Colt Rascal was displaying signs of neurological distress, and I was constantly under the impression that I was a bad parent.
             In order to be my best self for myself and my family, I ended up talking to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life and she promptly put me on fluoxetine (Prozac if you have good insurance.)
             The change was palpable in days. <b>DAYS!</b>
             We did what we could to keep the kids and ourselves sane.

         <h2>The Wrap Up</h2>

         <p>There's a lot that I didn't get a chance to mention like getting into tech, getting vaccinated, gaining momentum and contracting out to actual clients!
             I also started HRT and give myself shots of testosterone on a weekly basis. Thus far the only changes to report are a slightly deeper voice register and <b>THICK</b> chin hairs.
             It has been a trip and a half. But the love and lessons Missouri has offered are among some of my greatest treasures.
